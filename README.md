# KBKeyboardHandler
Original Author: Vladimir Grigorov

This is simply a port to Swift of the handler he wrote for the stackoverflow post below. The only changes I made were necessary to make this work in Swift (2.0 compiler). I do not own this, and simply added to GitHub so that others can use it in their Swift apps.
